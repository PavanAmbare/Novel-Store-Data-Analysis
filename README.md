# Novel-Store-Data-Analysis

ðŸŒŸ Situation:
In my recent project, I aimed to provide a comprehensive annual report for a fictional retail store, Novel Store, to visualize key business metrics and trends for the year 2024.

ðŸŒŸ Task:
The goal was to analyze and present the data in a clear, concise, and visually appealing manner using Excel. I needed to ensure that the report would provide valuable insights for decision-making, covering various aspects like sales trends, order statuses, demographic breakdowns, and performance across different channels and states.

ðŸŒŸ Action:
To achieve this, I:

Collected and organized data from various sources, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
Created dynamic dashboards using Excel's advanced features, including pivot tables, charts, and slicers.
Visualized key metrics such as orders vs. sales trends over months, sales distribution by gender, top-performing states, and order status breakdown.
Segmented data by different channels and categories to highlight performance across platforms like Ajio, Amazon, Flipkart, and Meesho.
Analyzed demographic insights by plotting orders against age and gender to identify significant customer segments.

ðŸŒŸ Result:
The final dashboard provided a detailed, interactive, and easy-to-understand report that highlighted:

Monthly sales trends and order volumes.

Sales distribution between men and women.

Performance of top five states in terms of sales.

Order statuses and their proportions.

Channel-wise order distribution.

Age and gender demographics of customers.
